# Deployment manifest:
- A deployment rollout is triggered if and only if the deployment's pod template is changed, for examle if the labels or container images of the template are updated. Updates such as scaling the deployment, do not trigger a rollout. When we update the deployment, The deployment update the pods by creating a new replicaset and scaling it up and scaling the old replicaset. 
    - ## Liveness and Readiness Probes: - 
        -`periodSeconds`: specifies that the kubelet should perform a liveness or readiness proble each x seconds. 
        -`initialDelaySeconds`: tells the kubelet that it should wait x seconds before performing the first probe
        - `failureTreshold`: after a probe fails failureTreshold times in a row, kubernetes considers that the overall check has failed.
        - for a failed readiness probe the kubelet continues running the container that failed the check and also continues to run more probes because the check failed(it sets ready condition of the pod to false). - for a failed liveness probe, if at least failuretreshold probes have failed, kubernetes treats the container as unhealthy and triggers a restart for that container into account.
        - `successTreshold`: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed
        - `timeoutSeconds`: Number of seconds after which the probe timesout 
    - ## Resource limits and requests: 
        - If no Ressource Request is specified: the pod will request 0.5 cpu and 256 Mi of memory. 
        - If no resource limit is specified: the pod will be limited to 1 cpu and 512 Mi of memory. 
        - If a pod tries to consume more cpu than its limit kubernetes throttles the pod but for the memory the pod will be terminated 
        - If only container limit is specified but not its request: For cpu the cpu request will be assigned the cpu limit. 
        - If you specify container's request but not its limit: the container will be assigned the default container limit 
        - If you want to change the default assigned values we need to create a new `LimitRange` resource. 
# Ingress: 
- Ingress may be configured to give service externally reachable URL5, load balance traffic, terminate ssl/tls, and offer name-based virtual hosting. 
- `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` : annotation can be used to specify which ingress controller should serve a particular ingress object. This annotation is deprecated and you should `spec.ingressClassName`.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough`: when enabled request will not be decrypted at the load balancer but passed along to a server for decryption. SSL passthough is used when web application security is a top concern. 
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol`: le protocol de communication entre le ingress controller et le backend. 
- `kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http`: if you want to disable HTTP traffic between the client and the load balancer you should mark it false.
